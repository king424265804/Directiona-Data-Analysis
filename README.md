# Directiona-Data-Analysis HW1
The directionalData.Rmd file in this repository was created by R Markdown and will has the output similar to the directionalData.org file created by Dr. Presnell.
And the directionalData.html file was the output of directionalData.Rmd. But it seems that there is some trouble in viewing it in github. So you may have to download it to see the whole picture of this file.
